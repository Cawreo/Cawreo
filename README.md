**`AGI Scientist`**

 I am a professional open source AI contributor and power coder for Python, on a mission to transform human-computer interaction (HCI) and human-machine interaction (HMI) with AI. 
 As a technologist, I'm fascinated by the possibilities that emerge at the intersection of code and intelligence, where lines of code wield the power to shape industries with automation and transform human lives on 
 Earth. 
 My mission is to break down the barriers that have hindered the widespread adoption of AI, bringing the power of machine learning and deep learning to every corner of our planet. 
 From innovative Python scripts to groundbreaking AI creations, my research and repositories are a testament to the relentless pursuit of excellence and progress in the world of technology.
